* I have some cats that will buy their tickets later, can they sit with me? *

If you have cats who will buy their tickets later that might want to sit with you,
your table code is <%= @payment.table_code %>. They can enter this when they buy a
ticket and we'll try our best to seat them with you. Note that due to the limited
number of tables we may not always be able to do this, but we'll attempt to meet
everyone's requests, giving preference to those who bought their tickets earlier.
If your friends and you have already bought tickets without linking them, email us
and we'll link your tickets for you.

Thanks, and looking forward to seeing you there!
- The Cat Council.
